## Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Monitor Events**: Security events appear in the alert pane in real-time
2. **Analyze Threats**: Examine event details to determine severity and appropriate response
3. **Respond to Incidents**: Apply appropriate mitigation actions to security events
4. **Create Detection Rules**: Build automated rules to handle recurring threat patterns
5. **Prevent Escalations**: Address critical threats before they escalate and impact system uptime
6. **Advance Levels**: Progress through increasingly challenging scenarios as your skills improve

### Scoring System

Points are awarded based on:
- Successfully handling malicious events
- Response speed (faster responses earn more points)
- Maintaining high network uptime
- Avoiding false positive actions

### Levels

The game features progressive difficulty levels:
1. **Level 1: Basic Scan Detection** - Focus on recognizing basic reconnaissance attempts
2. **Level 2: Exploit Attempts** - Counter exploitation and malware execution attempts
3. **Level 3: Data Exfiltration** - Prevent data breaches and advanced persistent threats

## Technical Architecture

Defender's Dashboard is built using a modular JavaScript architecture with an event-driven design pattern. The application uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML5/CSS3 without external frameworks, making it lightweight and easy to deploy.

### Core Components

#### Game Model

The `gameModel.js` serves as the central state management system, storing:
- Current game state (running/paused)
- Player score and level progression
- Network uptime and health metrics
- Event history and pending threats
- Game settings and difficulty parameters

#### Event Generator

The `eventGenerator.js` module creates randomized security events based on:
- Event templates defined in `threats.js`
- Current level difficulty settings
- Event probability distributions
- Type-specific properties (IPs, usernames, error codes, etc.)

#### Controllers

Multiple controller modules handle specific game aspects:
- `gameController.js`: Main game loop and simulation control
- `ruleEngine.js`: Custom rule creation and evaluation
- `uiController.js`: DOM updates and user interface management
- `simulationController.js`: Attack path visualizations for escalated events 
- `briefsController.js`: Threat intelligence updates and educational content
- `escalationsController.js`: Handles consequences of unmitigated threats

#### Event Bus

The `eventBus.js` provides a central publish/subscribe system for inter-module communication, allowing loosely coupled components to react to game events without direct dependencies.

### Event Flow

1. **Event Generation**: The event generator creates security events based on templates and current level settings
2. **Event Processing**: Generated events are added to the game model and displayed in the UI
3. **Rule Evaluation**: The rule engine checks events against player-created detection rules
4. **Player Interaction**: The player can analyze events and apply mitigation actions
5. **Escalation Check**: Unhandled malicious events may escalate after a timeout period
6. **Consequence Application**: Escalated events affect game metrics like network uptime
7. **State Updates**: Game state changes trigger UI updates through the event bus

## Customization

### Adding Custom Threats

To add custom threat types to the game, modify the `threats.js` file by adding new event templates to the `possibleEvents` array:

```javascript
// Example custom threat
{
    type: "custom_threat_type",      // Unique identifier for event type
    category: "malicious",           // "malicious", "noise", or "false_positive"
    description: "Description of threat", // Human-readable description
    likelihood: 0.1,                 // Probability factor (0.0 to 1.0)
    baseSeverity: 5,                 // Severity level (1-10)
    domain: "category_area",         // Domain area (network, web, endpoint, etc.)
    escalation: "escalation_type",   // Escalation scenario identifier
    remediation: "action_type",      // Comma-separated list of effective actions
    education: "Educational context for this threat type" // Learning information
}
```

Important properties to include:
- **type**: Unique identifier used throughout the application
- **category**: Must be "malicious" for actual threats (or "noise"/"false_positive" for non-threats)
- **likelihood**: Controls frequency (higher values appear more often)
- **baseSeverity**: Affects scoring and escalation impact (1-10 scale)
- **escalation**: Must match a simulation type in simulationController.js
- **remediation**: List of actions that will be effective against this threat

### Adding Custom Simulations

To add visualizations for custom threat types, add a new simulation definition to the `simulationLibrary` object in `simulationController.js`:

```javascript
// Example custom simulation
custom_threat_type: {
    title: "Custom Threat Simulation",
    description: "Description of how this attack progresses.",
    icon: "üîç",  // Emoji icon for the simulation
    framework: "MITRE ATT&CK",
    steps: [
        {
            id: "step-one",
            title: "Initial Access",
            description: "Description of the first stage of attack.",
            technicalDetails: "Technical explanation of how this works.",
            mitreTactic: "TA0001: Initial Access",
            mitreTechnique: "T1566: Phishing",
            indicators: "Observable signs of this activity",
            prevention: "How to prevent this step",
            icon: "üö™"
        },
        // Add at least 3-5 steps to show attack progression
        {
            id: "step-two",
            title: "Execution",
            description: "Description of the second stage of attack.",
            technicalDetails: "Technical explanation of how this works.",
            mitreTactic: "TA0002: Execution",
            mitreTechnique: "T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter",
            indicators: "Observable signs of this activity",
            prevention: "How to prevent this step",
            icon: "‚öôÔ∏è"
        },
        // Additional steps...
    ]
}
```

Important considerations:
- The key (e.g., `custom_threat_type`) must match the `type` field in your threat definition
- Include at least 3-5 steps to properly visualize the attack progression
- Use MITRE ATT&CK references when possible for educational value
- Provide tangible indicators and prevention tips for each step

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. No build process or dependencies required

### Structure

The application follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns:
- **Model**: Game state and data management (`gameModel.js`)
- **View**: UI rendering and DOM manipulation (`uiController.js`)
- **Controller**: Game logic and event handling (various controller modules)

The event bus architecture allows for loose coupling between components, making the codebase more maintainable and extensible.

### Event Bus Architecture

The application uses a publish/subscribe pattern through the `eventBus.js` module:

```javascript
// Subscribe to an event
eventBus.subscribe('event:name', function(data) {
    // Handle event with data
});

// Publish an event
eventBus.publish('event:name', { 
    // Event data
});
```

This architecture makes it easy to extend the application with new features without modifying existing code.
